# Road_Traffic_Severity_Classification ðŸš¦
## Introduction
As our road networks, number of vehicles, drivers, and overall traffic continue to grow, it's becoming increasingly clear how crucial road traffic is for supporting economic and social progress. With this growth, ensuring the safety of people's lives and property on the roads has become a major concern. Road traffic accidents happen when various factors like human behavior, vehicle conditions, road conditions, and the environment interact in a way that leads to harm or damage. Therefore, it's important to study and understand the factors that influence these accidents and develop models that can help classify and identify how severe an accident might be. This research is essential for improving overall road safety and reducing the impact of accidents on people and society.


##  Problem Statement ðŸ¤”: 
This is a multi-class classification problem where we are predicting the severity of accident :
* Slight Injury
* Fatal Injury
* Serious Injury

## ðŸ§¾ Description: 
This data set is collected from **Addis Ababa Sub-city Police Departments** for master's research work. The data set has been prepared from manual records of road traffic accidents of the year 2017-20. All the sensitive information has been excluded during data encoding and finally it has 32 features and 12316 instances of the accident.


## Issues Solved ðŸ“§:
Exploratory Data Analysis
Data Preprocessing
Imbalanced Dataset
Model Training
Hyperparameters Tuning
